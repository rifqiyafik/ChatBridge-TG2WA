## 🛠 Project Structure

```

.
├── src/index.js            # Main server file
├── auth_info/          # WhatsApp auth session folder (auto-created)
└── README.md           # You're here!

```

## 🔐 Notes

The QR code for login appears in the terminal when you POST to `/connect`.

The session is persisted in the `auth_info` folder.

If you delete the auth_info folder or call `/logout`, you'll need to rescan the QR code.
